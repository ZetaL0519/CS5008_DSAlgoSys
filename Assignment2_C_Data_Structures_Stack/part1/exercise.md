Why is a stack a useful data structure and/or when do you think it could be used(i.e. to solve a particular problem or in a specific context)?

1. Why important?
Stack is an ordered collection of items where the addition of new items and removing of existing items takes place at the same end.The most recently added item is the one to be removed first. It is important because of its ordering. For computer system working, the system will deal with the most recent tasks one by one. The action that takes place most recently can be removed or seen first.
The con about stack is also the pro of the stack, which is the least recent element is more difficult to retreive.

2. Examples
(1) web browsers: backward and forward
(2) autofill function in IDE: examine if the brackets are in pairs.
(3) Redo-undo features in editor applications.

3. Time Complexity
Popping an element from a stack O(1)
Popping the last element O(n)
Push an element O(1)
